# Environment variables

We need a way to store some local state between workshop examples. We've implemented that by including the concept of environment variables to EDEE.

In this example, we store and use an envrionment variable named "SOME_VAR".

## Challenge

Click **GET** and specify "MongoDB Rocks!" as the value for the environment variable.

If you're reading this after already specifying a different value, uncomment `system.clearenv("SOME_VAR")` to clear the value, and then run GET again.
