One of the most common design patterns in MongoDB is the Bucket pattern.

A Bucket pattern us used where you want to store a number of small, related 
data points together for speed of retrieval to you push each new data point
into an array as it arrives.

This however gives you the issue that the array can grow without limit, this will
both impact performance once it becomes larger as it gets slower to update the record
once it grows larger. It also risks hitting a maximum size limit.

Instead, we limit the array size as before but use upsert to automatically create 
a new document once the limit is reached.

Upset (Update with insert)  flag means: If you do not find a document matching this
 query then create one using the query parameters and update modifiers.
