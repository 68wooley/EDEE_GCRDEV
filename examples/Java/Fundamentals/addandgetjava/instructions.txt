This example takes POSTed JSON text and parses it to a MongoDB document.
It does no validation of what is posted, you would in a real system.
It populates the _id field with the primary key and also converts two
String fields to Dates before adding to MongoDB

Get creates a query object and populates it from the URL before finding 
the matching document.

You will see the second time you post you hit a duplicate primary key error, update
the BookingId in the JSON to resolve that.
