Updates in MongoDB are based on a query and a set of modifications,
 many of which are relative to the current value.

 Increment a number, Push an element into an Array - not reading an oversriting.

 This combination of query conditions and relative updates means you can safely
 perform operation without taking a lock in advance, a lock is taken during
the operation to ensure that the operations are performed only if the conditions
are true.

In this case we are recording the 'IP Address' of someone calling this API -
imagine we are recording who views a page but we have also set a limit to record 
only the first N views then stop recording. In the next exercise we see a bit more of this.
