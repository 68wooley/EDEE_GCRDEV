This runs two queries on the same large data set.

One has an index and one does not, they return
almost the same number of documents.

It uses countDocuments() rather than find() which performs the find
but only returns the count from the server. This removes the network cost
of fetching a lot of documents from the measurement.

An index query will be a fairly constant speed although
you also see some significant network overhead from the call
in these results.

A collection scan (no index) will place a lot of load on the server
proportaional to the number of callers so ti may be very slow in a 
large class, be patient.
