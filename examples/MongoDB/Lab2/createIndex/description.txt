First run POST to CreateData to generate 10,000 documents with the structure

{
    colour: "Green",
    size: "large",
    shape: "triangle",
    price: 532
}

Then Change the URL to 'Index'
 - use POST to create index based on the POST data
 - use GET to see the examinedplin plan for the query

Edit the query and try different indexes to get perfect indexing,
Try having two indexes on on colour and one on shape
