You are building a task/workflow queue to assign resources to tasks.

You have three endpoints already defined:

 POST to /v1/Task will create a new Task record 
GET /v1/Task lists all tasks in all statuses.
POST to https://hostname:5500/service/Complete/<taskid> to flag a task as complete

You need to implement:

POST  /v1/Assign?resource=Worker123

This will find a single task that is not assigned and assign Worker123
to it setting the assignedTo,status and dateAssigned fields

Once you have that - modify it so that if any task has been in state 
assigned for more than 1 minute it will be allocated in preference to one
that is in state new - basically reassign abandoned tasks.


 You will need  to use the top level $or query operator
 { $or : [ query1, query2 ] }

 Also how can you make it prioritise abandoned tasks.
