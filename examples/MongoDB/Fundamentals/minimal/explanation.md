# Connecting to MongoDB

The first time you connect to MongoDB, you can give any unique username and a password of your choice - both must be at least 6 characters long. When rerunning this example, or any others, you'll not be asked for these
credentials again (your choices will be remembered).

Note that these credentials are stored in your browser in plain text, and so please don't use a password that you use for any real accounts. You won't be storing any sensitive data, so feel free to use an insecure password â€“ "**password**" is fine!

The `hello()` function fetches information about the state of the MongoDB Atlas cluster that's being used for this workshop.

## Challenge

Run **GET** to connect to the MongoDB database. It doesn't matter what username or password you use (though the username needs to be unique, and so you could use your email address).
