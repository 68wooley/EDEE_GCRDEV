This is a tool for learning MongoDB development.

It is Inspired by tools like the Arduino IDE for learning Microcontrollers and Processing for democratizing Java development. It is a simple, single standalone environment in which you can write and manually call  "Web Services". It uses a shared genuine MongoDB backend hosted on MongoDB Atlas serverless functions.

The easiest way to get started is to look at the examples, you have access to a special version of a MongoDB driver, whilst it's missing many of the features of the real driver you woud use from Node, Python, Java, C# or another language it has what's required to learn and practice core MongoDB concepts and build code similar to that you would build in a real development environment.

This driver and the Request and Response classes you use to interact with your web serve are also documented here.
