This is a tool for learning MongoDB development.

It is Inspuired by tools like the Arduino IDE for learning Microcontrollers and Processing for democratising Java development. It is a simple, single standalone envonment in which you can write and manually call  "Web Servics". It uses a shared genuine MongoDB backend hosted on MongoDB Atlas serverless fucntions.

The easiest way to get started is to look at the examples, you have access to a special version of a MongoDB driver , wholst it's missing many of the features of the real driver you woud use from Node, Python, Java, C# or another language it has what's required to learn and practise core MongoDB concepts and build code similar to that you woudl build in a real development environment.

This driver and the Request and Response classes you use to interact with your web serve are also documented here.
